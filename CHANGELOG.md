# About versioning

We are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) here but considering also the generated models point of view.

This means that:
 * **patch version** number is bumped if we have a simple bugfix in the code which does not really have implication on generated models
 * **minor version** number is bumped if the code brings something new feature but
    * the generated models remain backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous version (within the same major version of course)
    * config options of the generator itself also remains backward compatible with the previous version (within the same major version of course)
 * **major version** number is bumped if we have breaking changes anywhere namely
    * the generated models might not be backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous major version
    * a config option of the generator itself is removed or renamed



# release 2.0.0

## Breaking changes
 * field types and therefore ctor arguments/setters/getters etc might be different in the generated models
 * config option `nullableTagDefaultValue` was removed as it is better to stay with OpenApi standards (even if it is causing some discomfort...) which is `nullable=false` if attribute is ommited
 * `x-keytiles-serialize-only-if-non-default` property flag was removed and `x-keytiles-serialize-only-if-non-default-properties` was introduced at Object level instead - similar to how `required` works

## New features
 * Enhanced and more accurate rule system to figure out which properties should be `private` / `private final` / `public` fields and which fields should have setters and/or taken from constructor - see the updated README.md file! 
 * Generator now also can add `// @Generator WARNING` messages to the model fields/methods to mark clearly, inline if something can be fishy
 * Significantly enhanced `// @Generator` messages - they provide much much better info if `addExplanationsToModel` config option is turned on
 * Added mechanism to detect Java codegen bug https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/11821 and break the build if detected
 * Support of inheriting attributes of referred in objects/enums using `$ref`
 * Added support for array properties, `default: [...]` values is recognized and applied (but only for primitive types, objects not)
 * Introduced validation which makes sure only supported `x-keytiles-` vendor attributes are present in the schema - otherwise build will fail. This helps in future releases to detect accidental leftovers on schema files of `x-keytiles-` attributes which were deprecated and removed in the meantime can not be overlooked

## Bugfixes
 * During inheritance when Superclass has a constructor sometimes the Subclass did not pick up imports needed by Superclass - that lead to generated model compilation problems. This is now fixed (or at least better). Also added model structure to tested OpenApi schemas which is checking this works.
