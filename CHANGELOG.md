# About versioning

We are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) here but considering also the generated models point of view.

This means that:
 * **patch version** number is bumped if we have a simple bugfix in the code which does not really have implication on generated models
 * **minor version** number is bumped if the code brings something new feature but
    * the generated models remain backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous version (within the same major version of course)
    * config options of the generator itself also remains backward compatible with the previous version (within the same major version of course)
 * **major version** number is bumped if we have breaking changes anywhere namely
    * the generated models might not be backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous major version
    * a config option of the generator itself is removed or renamed

# release 1.1.0

## New features
 * Enhanced and more accurate rule system to figure out which properties should be `private` / `private final` / `public` fields and which fields should have setters and/or taken from constructor - see the updated README.md file! 
 * Generator now also can add `// @Generator WARNING` messages to the model fields/methods to mark clearly, inline if something can be fishy

## Bugfixes
none
