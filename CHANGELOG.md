# About versioning

We are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) here but considering also the generated models point of view.

This means that:
 * **patch version** number is bumped if we have a simple bugfix in the code which does not really have implication on generated models
 * **minor version** number is bumped if the code brings something new feature but
    * the generated models remain backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous version (within the same major version of course)
    * config options of the generator itself also remains backward compatible with the previous version (within the same major version of course)
 * **major version** number is bumped if we have breaking changes anywhere namely
    * the generated models might not be backward compatible (from the user/behavior perspective) with the models generated by the previous major version
    * a config option of the generator itself is removed or renamed



# release 2.0.0

## Breaking changes
 * field types and therefore ctor arguments/setters/getters etc might be different in the generated models
 * config option `nullableTagDefaultValue` was removed as it is better to stay with OpenApi standards (even if it is causing some discomfort...) which is `nullable=false` if attribute is ommited
 * `x-keytiles-serialize-only-if-non-default` property flag was removed and `x-keytiles-serialize-only-if-non-default-properties` was introduced at Object level instead - similar to how `required` works

## New features
 * Enhanced and more accurate rule system to figure out which properties should be `private` / `private final` / `public` fields and which fields should have setters and/or taken from constructor - see the updated README.md file! 
 * Generator now also can add `// @Generator WARNING` messages to the model fields/methods to mark clearly, inline if something can be fishy
 * Significantly enhanced `// @Generator` messages - they provide much much better info if `addExplanationsToModel` config option is turned on
 * Added mechanism to detect Java codegen bug https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/11821 and break the build if detected
 * Support of inheriting attributes of referred in objects/enums using `$ref`
 * Added support for array properties, `default: [...]` values is recognized and applied (but only for primitive types, objects not)
 * Introduced validation which makes sure only supported `x-keytiles-` vendor attributes are present in the schema - otherwise build will fail. This helps in future releases to detect accidental leftovers on schema files of `x-keytiles-` attributes which were deprecated and removed in the meantime can not be overlooked
 * Added support for composition of Enums - see README for more details
 * Added KeytilesJavaCodegen.support_mapDefaultValue(CodegenModel, CodegenProperty) method - which makes the default '= null' in case the map field is nullable (instead of creating a new HashMap<>() instance)
 * pojo.mustache was modified to add (back) helper methods to add/remove values to/from non-readonly array and map fields. The add methods are doing a null check and initiating the container field in case its null.
 * Significantly enhanced mechanisms to recognize and deal with 'extends' and property override - until "Java limitations with generating models" (see README) not hit (also recognized) and fail the build if needed. In simpleConsistent style we do not allow original Java codegen strategy: "rename if conflicts" as that leads to messy models. In order to get this done:
    * Enhanced ExtraModelInfo - now it is recognizing "extends". If a property is assignable from a subclass property (same name) so to say. This makes it possible to optimize the constructor arguments and also the fields if superclass is actually capable of storing something "extended" value
    * Enhanced CodegenUtil - this is participating in ExtraModelInfo enhancements
       * .isModelAssignableFromModel() was introduced
       * .isPropertyAssignableFromProperty() was introduced
       * CodegenUtilTest is added to extensively test the above two things
    * For testing TestUtils was added and this makes it possible to trigger the Keytiles codegen from unit test level allowing us to create tests where we actually expect the Codegen to fail. BuildFailsTest was added therefore which checks the README "Java limitations with generating models" section cases

## Bugfixes
 * During inheritance when Superclass has a constructor sometimes the Subclass did not pick up imports needed by Superclass - that lead to generated model compilation problems. This is now fixed (or at least better). Also added model structure to tested OpenApi schemas which is checking this works.
 * Renaming ENUMs based on common prefixes (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/5932 and https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/7725 - NOT FIXED!) problem is fixed by overriding findCommonPrefixOfVars() method
