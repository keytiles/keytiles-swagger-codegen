    # This is trciky. In this test we create a
    # - private field in BaseClass
    # - but public override field in SubClass
    # They are not compatible
    # We do not support at the moment "changing visibility" of a field so it should fail
  

    # this will be our base class
    BaseClass:
      type: object
      properties:
        # one single string errorCode - private field, it has a default but it does not matter
        errorCode:
          type: string
          nullable: false
          default: ''
            
    # and this is extending BaseClass and overriding the field
    SubClass:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BaseClass'    
      type: object
      properties:
        # override error code with incompatible type - same private field even more relaxed but still
