    # In this test we create a public List<> field in BaseClass and SubClass
    # They are not compatible with inner type
    # This would be OK in a case of public fields but here we enforce BaseClass to take this
    # from the Constructor - and this is definitely causing problems so we should fail
  

    # this will be our base class
