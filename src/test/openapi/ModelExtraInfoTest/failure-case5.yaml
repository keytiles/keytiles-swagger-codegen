    # In this test we create a private field in BaseClass and SubClass

    # This would cause issues with the Getter so we have to fail
  

    # this will be our base class
    BaseClass:
      type: object
      properties:
        # one single string errorCode - private field (nullable false), it has a default but it does not matter

          type: string
          nullable: false
          default: ''
