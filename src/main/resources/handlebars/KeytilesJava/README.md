# Templates folder

This folder has subfolders in sync with com.keytiles.swagger.codegen.ModelStyle enums.

## 'inherited' subfolder

This folder is an actual copy from the Java language templates from here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators/tree/master/src/main/resources/handlebars/Java

And then I started to alter it slightly (hack, but works :-) and guarantees backward compatibility fully!)

**note:** Where I altered files I saved the original ones under `!bak` subfolder! So its easy to compare for changes!

## 'simpleConsistent'

A more heavily altered template set to conform with rules defined in this generation style
